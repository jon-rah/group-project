# Data Types, Variables and Functions

As we learn about the basics of programming as illustrated in Python, it will be helpful to recognize some of the different data types (kinds of values) that are commonly used in programming. Some of the most important data types in Python are:
 - Integers
 - Floating Point Numbers (floats)
 - Strings
 - Boolean (logical) values
In addition to the simple data types, there are a few data types that are used to group the simple types together. The compound data types that we will encounter most often in Python are:

```{python}
import face_recognition
import cv2

# This is a super simple (but slow) example of running face recognition on live video from your webcam.
# This requires OpenCV (the `cv2` library) to be installed only to read from your webcam.

# Get a reference to webcam #0 (the default one)
video_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

# Load a sample picture and learn how to recognize it.
jon_image = face_recognition.load_image_file("jon.jpg")
jon_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(jon_image)[0]

# Load a second sample picture and learn how to recognize it.
drm_image = face_recognition.load_image_file("drm.jpg")
drm_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(drm_image)[0]

# Create arrays of known face encodings and their names
known_face_encodings = [
    jon_face_encoding,
    drm_face_encoding
]
known_face_names = [
    "Jon Rahseparian",
    "Nathan Malmberg"
]

while True:
    # Grab a single frame of video
    ret, frame = video_capture.read()

    # Convert the image from BGR color (which OpenCV uses) to RGB color (which face_recognition uses)
    rgb_frame = frame[:, :, ::-1]

    # Find all the faces and face enqcodings in the frame of video
    face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(rgb_frame)
    face_encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(rgb_frame, face_locations)

    # Loop through each face in this frame of video
    for (top, right, bottom, left), face_encoding in zip(face_locations, face_encodings):
        # See if the face is a match for the known face(s)
        matches = face_recognition.compare_faces(known_face_encodings, face_encoding)

        name = "Unknown"

        # If a match was found in known_face_encodings, just use the first one.
        if True in matches:
            first_match_index = matches.index(True)
            name = known_face_names[first_match_index]

        # Draw a box around the face
        cv2.rectangle(frame, (left, top), (right, bottom), (0, 0, 255), 2)

        # Draw a label with a name below the face
        cv2.rectangle(frame, (left, bottom - 35), (right, bottom), (0, 0, 255), cv2.FILLED)
        font = cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_DUPLEX
        cv2.putText(frame, name, (left + 6, bottom - 6), font, 1.0, (255, 255, 255), 1)

    # Display the resulting image
    cv2.imshow('Video', frame)

    # Hit 'q' on the keyboard to quit!
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release handle to the webcam
video_capture.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
