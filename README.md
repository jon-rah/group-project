GOAL:

Detect and recognize faces from Python with the world’s simplest face recognition library. We would also like to build a custom face recognition dataset to allow for facial recognition enrollment of group members.

RESOURCES:

In order to perform face recognition with Python and OpenCV we need to install two:


The dlib library, maintained by Davis King, contains our implementation of “deep metric learning” which is used to construct our face embeddings used for the actual recognition process.

The face_recognition  library, created by Adam Geitgey, wraps around dlib’s facial recognition functionality, making it easier to work with.

MEMBERS DUTIES:

Aurora-Frisby, installing the libraries needed to actually perform our face recognition

Ruth-King, building our custom face recognition dataset

Jon-Rah, implementing face recognition for both still images and video streams
